Due to time constraints, we have currently uploaded the automatic annotation script, the pruned segmentation head model, and the trained model weights. We will continue to maintain and update our repository in the future to facilitate reproduction by the community.

After setting up the YOLOv8 environment, you can modify the model’s head code and the corresponding YAML configuration file to perform training.

If you have any questions, feel free to leave a comment or start a discussion!
